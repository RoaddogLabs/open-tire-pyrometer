Version 2 - Functional Prototype (Beta) 
  
In general the "tall" version should be printed. The only difference is that it is 2mm taller. This extra space makes it easier to contain all the components (especially for use with a connector on the therocouple pcb).
If a more compact version is prefered the "short" version can be printed. When assembling the short version there is NO space for using connectors on the thermalcouple PCB or the power switch. Both must be hard wired.  
  
Printed on Lulzbot Mini with .5mm nozzle using eSun PLA+ at 220C. Recommended layer height is .2mm. For this part to print properly you must have a printer with good dimensional accuracy!
